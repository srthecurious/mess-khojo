# Remotion Instagram Video Plan

The goal is to create a 9:16 (1080x1920) video for Instagram demonstrating a specific user flow on the Mess Khojo website.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This plan relies on running a Puppeteer script (`scripts/capture_instagram.js`) on your local machine to capture fresh screenshots of your running application.
> Ensure your app is running at `http://localhost:5173` (or the address used in the script) before generating the video.

## Proposed Changes

### Client Video Project

#### [NEW] [capture_instagram.js](file:///c:/Users/barma/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/mess-khojo/client/video/scripts/capture_instagram.js)
- A new Puppeteer script to capture the specific sequence of screenshots:
    1.  `home.png`: Initial Home Page.
    2.  `home_scrolled.png`: Scrolled to the 6th mess card.
    3.  `details.png`: Mess Details page.
    4.  `room_modal.png`: Room card opened/Request Call modal.
    5.  `confirm.png`: After clicking confirm (if applicable) or the state just before.
- Will set viewport to mobile size (1080x1920 or equivalent aspect ratio).

#### [NEW] [InstagramVideo.tsx](file:///c:/Users/barma/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/mess-khojo/client/video/src/InstagramVideo.tsx)
- A new Remotion component for the Instagram video.
- **Composition Settings**: 1080x1920, 30fps.
- **Content**:
    -   Sequentially shows the captured screenshots.
    -   Adds a "Cursor" or "Touch" animation overlay to indicate clicks at the specified moments.
    -   Smooth transitions (scrolling simulation).

#### [MODIFY] [Root.tsx](file:///c:/Users/barma/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/mess-khojo/client/video/src/Root.tsx)
- Register the new `InstagramVideo` composition.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run `node scripts/capture_instagram.js` to verify screenshots are generated correctly in `public/screenshots`.
- Run `npm start` (Remotion Preview) and check the "InstagramVideo" composition.

### Manual Verification
- Inspect the generated screenshots to ensure they match the requested flow.
- Watch the Remotion preview to verify timing and click animations.
