# Mess Khojo - Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
Build "Mess Khojo", a web application connecting users with mess/hostel rooms.
- **Admin Interface**: Secure login, manage room listings (photos, details).
- **User Interface**: Public access to view room listings.
- **Tech Stack**: React (Frontend), Firebase (Backend-as-a-Service).

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Firebase Configuration**: You will need to provide the Firebase configuration object (API keys, etc.) after I set up the project structure. I cannot create the Firebase project for you on the Google Console.

## Proposed Changes

### Configuration
#### [NEW] client/src/firebase.js
- Initialize Firebase App.
- Export `auth`, `db` (Firestore), `storage`.

### Frontend (Client)
#### [NEW] client/package.json
- Dependencies: `firebase`, `react`, `react-dom`, `react-router-dom`, `lucide-react`, `framer-motion`.

#### [NEW] client/src/App.jsx
- Routing setup (/, /admin/login, /admin/dashboard).
- Context providers for Auth if needed.

#### [NEW] client/src/pages/Home.jsx
- Fetch rooms from Firestore `rooms` collection.
- Display in responsive grid.

#### [NEW] client/src/pages/AdminLogin.jsx
- Firebase `signInWithEmailAndPassword`.
- **Note**: No sign-up option. Admins must be manually created in Firebase Console.

#### [NEW] client/src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx
- List rooms (Real-time updates from Firestore).
- "Add Room" form:
    - Upload image to Firebase Storage.
    - Save metadata to Firestore.

#### [NEW] client/src/components/RoomCard.jsx
- Reusable component for displaying room info.

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
- **Setup**: User provides Firebase config.
- **Admin**:
    - Login with test credentials (created in Firebase Console).
    - Upload a room image and details.
    - Verify image appears in Storage and data in Firestore.
- **User**:
    - Verify Home page loads data from Firestore.
