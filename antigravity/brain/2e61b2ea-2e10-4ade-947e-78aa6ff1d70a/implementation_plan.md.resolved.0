# Mess Khojo - Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
Build "Mess Khojo", a web application connecting users with mess/hostel rooms.
- **Admin Interface**: Secure login, manage room listings (photos, details).
- **User Interface**: Public access to view room listings.
- **Tech Stack**: React (Frontend), Node.js/Express (Backend), SQLite (Database), Local Storage for images.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> Using a local SQLite database and local file storage for simplicity and "free" usage without cloud setup. This means the app is self-contained.
