# Implement PWA Functionality

## Goal Description
Enable Progressive Web App (PWA) features to allow the "Install App" button to function. This involves configuring a service worker and ensuring all PWA criteria are met.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> I will install `@ducanh2912/next-pwa` to handle PWA configuration easily. This is a standard maintained fork of `next-pwa`.

## Proposed Changes
### Configuration
#### [MODIFY] [next.config.ts](file:///c:/Apps/NEETrack/NEETrack/next.config.ts)
- Wrap the next config with `withPWA`.

### Dependencies
- Install `@ducanh2912/next-pwa`.

### Assets
- Ensure `public/sw.js` is generated (handled by plugin).

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- None.

### Manual Verification
- [ ] Run `npm run dev`.
- [ ] Open localhost in Chrome.
- [ ] Check Application tab -> Manifest (should be valid).
- [ ] Check Application tab -> Service Workers (should be registered).
- [ ] Verify "Install App" button is enabled and triggers the prompt.
