# Application Preview & PWA Walkthrough

I have successfully set up the environment, started the development server, and implemented PWA functionality.

## Changes Made
- Installed project dependencies using `npm install`.
- Installed `@ducanh2912/next-pwa` for PWA support.
- Configured [next.config.ts](file:///c:/Apps/NEETrack/NEETrack/next.config.ts) to use the PWA plugin.
- Verified generation of [sw.js](file:///c:/Apps/NEETrack/NEETrack/public/sw.js) (Service Worker).

## Verification Results
### Automated Tests
- The browser preview tool encountered a temporary issue.

### Manual Verification
- The server is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- **To verify the "Install App" button:**
    1. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in Chrome.
    2. Open Developer Tools (F12) -> Application tab.
    3. Check that a Service Worker is registered.
    4. The "Install App" button should now be enabled (green).
    5. Clicking it should trigger the browser's install prompt.
