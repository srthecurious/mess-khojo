# Mess Khojo - Design Walkthrough

I have created a set of stunning, modern interface designs for the Mess Khojo app, stored in the `mess-khojo-designs` folder.

## Design Highlights
- **Premium Aesthetic**: Used a deep blue/slate color palette with vibrant gradients (`#6366f1`, `#ec4899`).
- **Glassmorphism**: Implemented translucent panels with blur effects for a modern feel.
- **Interactivity**: Added hover states, smooth transitions, and micro-animations.

## Screenshots

### 1. Dashboard Concept

### 2. File Naming Interface
A specific component for renaming files, featuring a modal layout with file preview and extension handling.
