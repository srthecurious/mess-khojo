# Implementation Plan - Mess Khojo Designs

## Goal
Create stunning interface ideas for the "Mess Khojo" app and a specific "file naming interface" component. These will be stored in a `mess-khojo-designs` folder.

## Proposed Changes

### Directory Structure
- Create folder: `mess-khojo-designs`

### [NEW] File Naming Interface
- `mess-khojo-designs/file-naming.html`: A standalone component showing a slick, modern UI for renaming files (e.g., input field with validation, save/cancel buttons, maybe a modal style).

### [NEW] Stunning Interface Ideas
- `mess-khojo-designs/dashboard.html`: A main dashboard view for "Mess Khojo" (assuming it's a mess finding/management app).
    - Features: Search bar, card layout for messes, vibrant colors, glassmorphism effects.
- `mess-khojo-designs/styles.css`: Shared styles for a consistent "premium" look.

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
- Open `file-naming.html` and `dashboard.html` in the browser to verify the "stunning" aesthetics and responsiveness.
