# Implementation Plan - Multiple Image Upload for Rooms

The goal is to allow admins to upload up to 5 images for a single room.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The data structure for rooms will change. New rooms will have an `imageUrls` array field.
> - Existing rooms with `imageUrl` will need to be handled (backward compatibility).
> - The UI for adding/editing rooms will be updated to support multiple file selection and preview.

## Proposed Changes

### Client

#### [MODIFY] [AdminDashboard.jsx](file:///c:/Users/barma/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/mess-khojo/client/src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx)
- Update `formData` or state to hold multiple selected files.
- Update file input to `multiple` and enforce 5-file limit.
- Update [handleRoomSubmit](file:///c:/Users/barma/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/mess-khojo/client/src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx#147-202) to:
    - Upload multiple files to Firebase Storage.
    - Save `imageUrls` array to Firestore.
- Update Edit Room logic to:
    - Display existing images from `imageUrls` (or `imageUrl` for old records).
    - Allow removing existing images.
    - Allow adding new images (up to the total limit of 5).

#### [MODIFY] [RoomCard.jsx](file:///c:/Users/barma/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/mess-khojo/client/src/components/RoomCard.jsx)
- Update to handle `room.imageUrls` array.
- Fallback to `room.imageUrl` if array is missing.
- Implement a simple image carousel or display the first image with an indicator of total images.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1.  **Admin Dashboard**:
    -   Login as admin.
    -   Create a new room.
    -   Select 5 images.
    -   Verify upload works and room is created.
    -   Edit the room.
    -   Verify all 5 images are shown.
    -   Remove one image, add another. Save.
    -   Verify changes persist.
2.  **User View (Mess Details)**:
    -   Go to Mess Details page.
    -   Check the Room Card for the new room.
    -   Verify images are displayed (carousel or main image).
