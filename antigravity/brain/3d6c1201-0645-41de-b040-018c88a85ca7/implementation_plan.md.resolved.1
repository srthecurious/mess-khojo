# Implementation Plan - Multiple Image Upload for Rooms

The goal is to allow admins to upload up to 5 images for a single room.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The data structure for rooms will change. New rooms will have an `imageUrls` array field.
> - Existing rooms with `imageUrl` will need to be handled (backward compatibility).
> - The UI for adding/editing rooms will be updated to support multiple file selection and preview.

## Proposed Changes

### Client

#### [MODIFY] [AdminDashboard.jsx](file:///c:/Users/barma/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/mess-khojo/client/src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx)
- Update `formData` or state to hold multiple selected files.
- Update file input to `multiple` and enforce 5-file limit.
- Update [handleRoomSubmit](file:///c:/Users/barma/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/mess-khojo/client/src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx#147-202) to:
    - Upload multiple files to Firebase Storage.
    - Save `imageUrls` array to Firestore.
- Update Edit Room logic to:
    - Display existing images from `imageUrls` (or `imageUrl` for old records).
    - Allow removing existing images.
    - Allow adding new images (up to the total limit of 5).

#### [MODIFY] [App.jsx](file:///c:/Users/barma/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/mess-khojo/client/src/App.jsx)
- Add route `/room/:roomId` pointing to `RoomDetails`.

#### [NEW] [RoomDetails.jsx](file:///c:/Users/barma/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/mess-khojo/client/src/pages/RoomDetails.jsx)
- Create new page to display full room details.
- Fetch room data by ID.
- Display image gallery (carousel/grid) for `imageUrls`.
- Show all room amenities and details.
- Add "Book Now" or contact button.

#### [MODIFY] [RoomCard.jsx](file:///c:/Users/barma/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/mess-khojo/client/src/components/RoomCard.jsx)
- Wrap card content in `Link` to `/room/${room.id}`.
- Update to handle `room.imageUrls` array (show first image as thumbnail).

## Verification Plan
